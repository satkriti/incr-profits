When you go through the dashboard created on :

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/satkriti/viz/Supermarket_16563235987990/Dashboard2?publish=yes 

You can observe that regions are divided into four sections: east, west, north and south. 
Upon clicking on any particular region the dashboard adjusts to show the filtered region selected by you.

For instance, if you select region Central, you can witness that it has the least profit and there Texax is the country with lowest profits under category of goods as Furniture. 
The graph on lower right displays the subcategories and we can note that chairs sale is extremely negative in Texas.

Insight: We could reduce furniture stocks from Texas supermarkets, especially on Chairs followed by Binders(from office Sales category) as they have least profits.
